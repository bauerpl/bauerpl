My name is Pawel. I spent over 7 years managing and leading Engineering Team at [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com) - design platform that allows product teams and designers to build low and high-fidelity, interactive, realistic web and mobile wireframes and prototypes. 

I was responsible for tech strategy, cloud architecture, scaling product development, and talent management. We grew from 2 to 25+ engineers and developed product that supports thousands of happy customers today. 

UXPin [was acquired](https://www.prweb.com/releases/xenon_partners_acquires_uxpin_a_leading_collaborative_design_and_prototyping_platform/prweb17173400.htm) in 2020 ðŸŽ‰ by [Xenon Partners](https://xenon.io).

Feel free to reach out to me here [here](https://neubauer.pl) ðŸ“«.
