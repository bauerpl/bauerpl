My name is Pawel Neubauer and for over 7 years I worked as a CTO of [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com) - a SaaS platform where you can design and manage your entire UX/UI project in one tool.

During these years I was responsible for tech strategy and platform architecture, but also for leading, managing and scaling the whole UXPin Engineering Team.

Together we built one of the most advanced UI/UX design platforms on the market with powers of code components, logic, states and design systems.

Thanks to many years of efforts, UXPin ([acquired](https://www.prweb.com/releases/xenon_partners_acquires_uxpin_a_leading_collaborative_design_and_prototyping_platform/prweb17173400.htm) in 2020 ðŸŽ‰ by [Xenon Partners](https://xenon.io).) still supports thousands of happy product teams all over the world.


Feel free to reach out to me [here](https://techcopilot.co) ðŸ“«.
